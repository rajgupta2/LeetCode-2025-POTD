/*
Minimize XOR
x has the same number of set bits as num2, and
The value x XOR num1 is minimal.
Note that XOR is the bitwise XOR operation.
Return the integer x. The test cases are generated such that x is uniquely determined.
The number of set bits of an integer is the number of 1's in its binary representation
